 ❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function add(a,c){ return a+b }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function attempts to add `a` and `b`, but `b` is not defined within the function scope. This will lead to an error (likely a `ReferenceError`).
*   ❌ The function argument `c` is defined but not used. This is unnecessary and can be confusing.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔️  Replaced unused argument `c` with `b`.
*   ✔️  Corrected the addition to use the intended `b` parameter.
*   ✔️  Added a semicolon for code clarity and consistency

Final Note:
It's important to ensure all variables used in a function are either passed as arguments or defined within the function's scope to prevent unexpected errors. Always double-check for typos and unused variables during development.
